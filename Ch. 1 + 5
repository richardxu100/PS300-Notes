> PS 300 - Comparative Politics

## Key concepts: an overview

**Question: What is comparative politics?** 

* **Concept:** an idea, term or category such as democracy, that is best identified with a definition restricted to its inherent characteristics
* **Conception:** a broader version of concept, which builds on perspectives and interpretations of a concept.
  - ex. We can conceive of democracy as self-government, direct democracy, or representative government
* **Social Science:** the study of human society and of interactions among people. 

**Conclusion:** 
Comparative politics is the study of the institutions, behavior, and performance of gov.t and political processes in different societies. 

## Government and governance
* **Government:** the arena for making and enforcing collective institutions. 
  - Also referred to as a specific administration (Putin), a form of rule (centralized gov.t), and the nature of rule of an administration (good/bad gov.t)
  - Includes police, military, public servants, and judges
* Idea of gov.t came from Hobbes, who believed that it would allow for mutually benefical cooperation. 
* **HOWEVER:** Locke repudiated this idea, saying that we gov.t can create new problems (who's going to look over the guards?)
* **Political System:** the interactions and organizations through which a society enforces collective decisions. Interchangeable with regime, though better connotation.
* **Governance:** the whole range of actors involved in gov.t, in which decisions and policies are made. 
  - Has a more publicly regulated feel, unlike gov.t's command/control power
  - Is a supplement, not replacement to gov.t

## Politics
* **Politics:** the process in which people compete and negotiate for collective decisions. 
  - Is kind of a nebulous term. Can there be politics in the workplace?
  - Has three clear aspects
    + Collective activity
    + Affects at least two people, for a course of action or to resolve a dispute
    + Decisions made become authorative and binding. If a war is declared, you go to war or go to jail.
  - Crick and Aristotle didn't do a great job at explaining what politics actually is (their ideal). 
  - **Quote:** Mao Zedong - War is politics with bloodshed
* Politics is a mixture between love and war.

## Power
**Power:** the power to bring about intended effects, like influence
* Some people see power and politics as the mobilization of bias.
