# Chapter 3 - Democratic Rule
> PS 300 Comparative Politics

## Key Ideas
* Half of the world lives under democratic rule, even though there is no universally agreed upon definition of democracy. Democracy is an ideal and a system of gov.t
* Athenian democracy is often a standard which today's indirect democracies are judged upon
* Liberal democracy goes above representative democracy in that it limits gov.t and protects the rights of citizens
* B/c of lack of economic development, liberal democracy might not be a good short-term goal for low-income countries (don't have requisites). 
* Democracies spread from three waves, though a lack of trust in gov.t is leading to problems in democracy
* People study how old authoritarian forms of rule collapse, and the subsequent emergence of democracy

## Democratic rule: an overview
* **Democracy:** a system of rule in which gov.t is based on a fair and open mandate from all qualified citizens of a state
* **Democratization:** the process by which states build the institutions and processes that lead them to becoming democracies
* Features of a modern democracy:
  - regular, fair, competitive elections
  - predictable institutions with a system of checks and balances
  - wide array of political participation, such as political parties
  - protection of individual rights and freedoms, sustained by a judiciary
  - active, effective, and protected opposition
  - diverse and independent media, free to share a wide array of opinions
* Democracy is the worst form of gov.t besides all of the other ones
* Three different types:
  - Direct
  - Representative
  - Liberal

## Direct democracy
* **Direct democracy:** a system of gov.t in which all members of a community take part in decisions that affect the community
* The model that was in place in Athens
* Athenian democracy didn't include all adults, only men, had weak turnout for meetings, was time-consuming, overly complex, and lead to incoherent policy that destroyed Athens
  - A lot of people don't have interest or aren't informed about politics
* Direct democracy doesn't really exist today, can be seen in referendums
* **E-democracy:** a form of democracy in which everyone who is interested in a problem can express themselves via the internet or social media
  - **PROBLEMS:** 
    + Bandwagon effect, like hashtags
    + People who express themselves on social media are often more polarized
    + Creates issues of privacy
    + Need access to the internet, which is hard in poor areas
    + Internet can be manipulated by authoritarian regimes
    + **Echo chamber:** when people only seek out the information which fits their values and preconceived ideas (amplifies them)

## Representative democracy
* **Representative democracy:** a system of gov.t in which members of a community elect reps to represent their interests and to make decisions
*
