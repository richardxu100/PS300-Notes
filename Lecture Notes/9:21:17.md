# Transitions to Democracy and Backsliding
> 9/21/17

## Notes
* **Democratization:** process by which states build institutions and processes to become deomcracies.
* **Waves of democratization:** periods where more states are becoming democracies than not
  - **Huntington's Three Waves:** 
  - First wave: 1828-1926 (Britain, France, US, Germany).
    + A lot about consolidation of institutions, suffrage
  - Second wave: 1943-1962 (India, Israel, Japan, Italy, Germany, Ghana, Algeria)
    + Encouraged to democratize by the U.S.
  - Third wave: 1974-1991 (South and Eastern Europe, USSR, Latin America)
  - Fourth wave: Arab spring, Color revolutions in Eastern Europe
* Stages of Democratization
  - It's a slow process
  - Liberalization
  - Transition
  - Consolidation
    + People believe that democracy is the best system around
  - Deepening
* **O'Donnell's 'Delegative Democracy'**
  - Not consolidated or institutionalized
  - Prone to interruption and breakdown
  - Hybrid regimes
  - Majoritarian and individualistic
  - **Majoritarian:** when power is consolidated in the hands of one person who claims to have the support of the majority (paternalistic, I have your interests!)
  - **AKA:** hybrid regime, flawed democracy
  - Not representative, people in power weaken those institutions

### Case Studies
* South Korea: Successful democratic transition
  - A coup took power, and then the Olympics put some pressure for them to democratize
* Spain: Success, but backslid first
  - Became a democracy in 1979
  - Economic and political problems
  - Attempted Coup d'Ã©tat in 1981
  - Became a liberal dem.
* China: Some transition, but not a democracy
  - Economic reform, growing middle class ,elections
  - Still has a controlled media, supression of speech, human rights violations, large inequalities

### Questions
1. Are countries necessarily better off as democracies?
2. Is there a formula for successful democratic transitions?
