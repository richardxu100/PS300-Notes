# PS 300 - Comparative Politics
> 9/5/17

## Notes
**Question: How can we answer questions in comparative politics?** 

**Types of case selection systems:** 
* Most similar system design
* Most different system design

### Problems in Studying Comparative Politics
* Too much to know (too few cases, too many variables)
* What causes what? (lot of independent variables)
* What do things mean? / traveling concepts
  - Some concepts are different in different countries, like Speaker of the House in the U.S. (not called that anywhere else in the world)
* **Selection bias:** the cases we choose and the conclusions we draw (just choosing WEIRD countries)

## How do we study politics?
**What types of questions do we ask in political science?** 

* **Normative** - 'ought' questions (political scientists don't focus on this, subjective)
  - Should the gov.t provide healthcare to its people?
* **Positive** - 'is' questions (objective, our focus)   
  - Positivist, can use science and observations
  - Is voter turnout higher when we have proportional representation?

* **Scientific inquiry/method:** the process by which scientists propose explanations based on evidence
* **Independent variable:** things which influence the dependent variable (like age, income)
* **Dependent variable:** thing you are measuring, depending on independent variables (voter turnout)
* How are these variables related?
  - Positive vs negative correlations
  - Older, more turnout, or older, less turnout
* Correlation, Not Causation
