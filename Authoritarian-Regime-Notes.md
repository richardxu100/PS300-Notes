# PS 300 - Elections
Richard Xu

## Elections in authoritarian states
* Elections look nice to the outside world, which is why non-democratic rulers have them, but they're solely a pretense. 
	* Chinese Communist Party has local elections, but they're mostly hand-picked people 
* In Egypt, the elections were also fixed by the gov.t, which inflated numbers of participation and killed opposition parties 
* Iran has every political candidate be vetted by the Supreme Leader, and bars women from running. 
* Hybrid regimes don't do vote-rigging, but have other shady tactics that make circumstances favorable to them. 

## Voters in authoritarian states
* When you only have one party to vote for, you're not given much choice. 
* **Electoral authoritarianism:** a regime which gives the appearance of being democratic by having multiparty elections, but maintains authoritarian qualities
	* Nigeria and Algeria fall under this category
* **Electoral volatility:** the net change in party support from one election to another 
	* Electoral volatility is extremely high in new democracies, as parties are still developing their roots
* Turnout and result statistics are often manipulated in authoritarian regimes
* Voter turnout rates are comparable to democracies. 

## Public policy in authoritarian states
* Leaders of authoritarian gov.ts want to enrich themselves, their families, and keep themselves in power
* Authoritarian rulers may also lack the ability to create good policy because they're less educated 
* **Rent seeking:** seeking to ing to make an income from selling a scarce resource without adding real value (f.e. oil)
* **Resource curse:** when a state is rich in a particular natural resource, but nonetheless experiences low economic growth due to bad policy, corruption, and internal conflict. 
* China is an authoritarian regime that pursues long term policies for economic growth (unusual), because of the communist party's hold on its country. It's 2006 program of Building a Harmonious society sought to address icnome inequality and provide health care to the poor. 
* Good policy is hard to achieve in poor countries b/c officials are so poorly paid that they resort to corruption.
