# Chapter 6 Notes
> PS300 - Comparing government and politics

## Key Ideas

* There a variety of ways to do comparative political research
* Researchers make choices such as the unit of analysis, level of analysis, and variables to be studied
* The three main research methods are: the case study, quantitative approach (large quantity), and qualitative approach (small quantity, like 2 to 12)
  - The quantitative approach isn't at war with the qualitative one. The quantitative approach uses solely numbers, while the qualitative brings in other factors
  - The case study is the most often used mode for comparison
* Different results occur from qualitative vs quantitative and normative vs empirical research
* History is underused in comparative political research

## Comparing gov.t and politics: an overview

* **Methodology:** how a scientific study is conducted, the means used to reach a certain set of conclusions
* Research options
  - **Unit of analysis:** the object of study in comparative politics (ex. states, institutions, movements, policies, individuals, etc.)
  - **Level of analysis:** the level of study in comparative politics, such as the entire political system or the individual level
  - **Variable:** a changeable feature, factor, or element
* Three approaches to political research:
  - Experimental method - uses experimental and control groups to isolate certain stimuli
  - Statistical method - uses empirical data to create relationships among variables
  - **Comparative method:** same as statistical method, but draws conclusions from studying a small number of cases

## Case study method

* **Case study method:** a research method which involves a detailed study of a particular object (person, country, phenomena, etc.), as well as the context with in which that object exists.
* Case studies add value by offering themes and wider perspectives to a certain case
  - For example, just looking at the 2012 Japanese election is a study. Looking at it as a rise of power of Conservatives is a case study
* They look at how a range of factors interact in the context of the example being studied
* Five types of case studies
  - **Representative:** the typical case study, most often used
  - **Prototypical**
